        The Training Dashboard Website is an extension of the Troop 1094 website. The main functions of the 
        dashboard are explained below.
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Dashboard</h3>
    <hr class="divider">
    <p class="body-text">
        The dashboard has a row for each adult with their name, training expiration date, email address, 
        and any recent events they are registered for. The urgency of an adult's training (how soon it could 
        affect their chaperoning events) is color coded in the following method:
        <br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="color-text" style="color: #FF5E5E"><strong>Red (!)</strong></p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Chaperone has a registered event that they will not be able to go to because it is past their 
        training expiry date with priority on people who's training has not yet expired (will appear toward the 
        top of the color section in the table).
        <br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="color-text" style="color: #FFDE6A"><strong>Yellow (?):</strong></p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Chaperone is within two months of expiry or within six months of past expiry of training with priority 
        for people with registered events (will appear toward the top of the color section in the table).
        <br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="color-text" style="color: #64DE50"><strong>Green  (✓):</strong></p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Adult has an active training (completed and not within two months of expiration) and can have both a 
        registered event or none upcoming.
        <br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="color-text" style="color: gray"><strong>Gray</strong></p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Chaperone is past two years from previous expiry and has not renewed training.
    <br><br>
    </p>

    <p class="color-text"><i><u>Sorting</i></u></p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Each column in the dashboard has a sort button located after the ↑↓ symbol.
        <br><br>
        • First sort button in the far left allows sorting by urgency (colors)
        <br>
        • For the adult names, this will allow the dashboard to be displayed 
        alphabetically by last name. The ↑ will sort the names starting from 
        the beginning of the alphabetical list (A → Z) while ↓ will display 
        names by the reverse order (Z → A)
        <br>
        • In the expiration date section, the sort function can order the adults 
        by the most recent date or the oldest date
        <br>
        • Sorting is also functional alphabetically by email address.
    <br><br>
    </p>

    <p class="color-text"><i><u>Search</i></u></p>
    <p class="body-text">
        The dashboard contains an embedded search function that increases the convenience 
        of finding an adult.
        <br><br>
        • To use the search function, enter a keyword or text into the search bar located 
        above the dashboard table.
        <br>
        • Adults who have corresponding information that matches the keyword will be displayed 
        in the table while everything else is temporarily removed until text in the search is 
        deleted.
    <br><br>
    </p>

    <p class="color-text"><i><u>Email Messaging</i></u></p>
    <p class="body-text">
        The email address when clicked will link to an empty Gmail draft with the adult recipient's 
        email address, the email subject, and a template message pre-filled in the email.
        <br><br>
